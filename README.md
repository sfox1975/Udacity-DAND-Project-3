# Udacity-DAND-Project-3
Data wrangling and analysis of Honolulu OSM data using python and SQL

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with wrangling and cleaning a large data set (>50MB), importing the data set to a database (SQLite in this case) and then extracting and analyzing the data further. OpenStreetMap (OSM) data was selected for this exercise. I specifically chose the island of Oahu, Hawaii for this project.

## Additional Documents

1.	DAND_P3_Fox.pdf - Project report: contains details on the data wrangling and analysis process.

2.	data.py - Python code used in auditing and cleaning the OSM dataset. Portions of the code were adapted from the in-class Udacity case study example.

3. schema.py - Python code used for ensuring all OSM ways, way_tags, nodes and node_tags were formatted correctly.

4. MapPosition.txt -	A text file containing a link to the map position chosen (Oahu) and a short description of the area.

5.	sample.osm - An .osm file containing a sample part of the map region I used. The complete Oahu file was about 10X larger. 

6.	References.txt - A text file containing a list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc that I referred to or used in this project.
